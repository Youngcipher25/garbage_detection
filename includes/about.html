                Litter and waste management are critical challenges faced by both urban and rural areas. 
                By optimizing the detection process, we aim to help communities and organizations maintain cleanliness and promote sustainability. 
            </p>
            <p>
                At Garbage Detection, our goal is to harness the power of AI to foster healthier and cleaner environments. 
                Our AI-driven system classifies images into “Clean” or “Dirty,” making it easier for municipalities and environmental organizations to monitor and improve public spaces.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using TensorFlow and Flask, our model analyzes images and categorizes them based on cleanliness. 
                With support for bulk uploads, users can efficiently process multiple images at once, making large-scale cleanliness assessments quick and seamless.
            </p>
            <p>
                Join us in building a smarter, cleaner future—one image at a time!
